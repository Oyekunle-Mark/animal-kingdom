A golang web application that creates and reads a list of bird species.

Writes data to a postgres sql database.

This program uses a number of dependencies. It uses the gorilla mux library for routing and a third party 
package for postgre sql.

This is a tutorial app from the article **Build a web application in Go (golang)** by *Soham Kamani*
